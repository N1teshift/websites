# Modern AI System

**Status**: 🚧 To be implemented

This folder will contain the third generation of AI systems for mathematical object generation, leveraging the latest AI technology improvements.

## Purpose

This system will replace or complement the existing LangGraph and Legacy systems with a more modern, efficient approach.

## Implementation Notes

- This system should be designed to take advantage of the latest AI model capabilities
- Consider using newer LangChain features or alternative approaches
- Maintain compatibility with the existing `generateSettings` facade in `core/objectGeneration.ts`

## Integration

Once implemented, update `core/objectGeneration.ts` to include this system as an option alongside the legacy and LangGraph systems.
