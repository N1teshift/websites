# EXT1 October 6 Assessment - Data Cleanup Summary

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Only 3 students showing values for Oct 6 EXT1 in dashboard

---

## 🔍 Problem Investigation

### What Was Found

The October 6, 2025 EXT1 assessments had **two different versions** in the data:

**Version 1 (54 students):**
```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-06",
  "column": "EXT1",
  "type": "weekly_assessment",          // ← Old type (not shown in Class View)
  "assessment_id": "exercise-progress-weekly",
  "assessment_title": "Exercise Progress - Weekly Check"
}
```

**Version 2 (3 students only):**
```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-06",
  "column": "EXT1",
  "type": "classwork",                   // ← Classwork type (shown in Class View)
  "assessment_id": "classwork-ext-ext1",
  "assessment_title": "EXT1 assessment"
}
```

### Why Only 3 Students Showed Data

- **Class View** includes these assessment types: `['summative', 'homework', 'homework_graded', 'homework_reflection', 'test', 'classwork', ...]`
- **Class View does NOT include** `weekly_assessment` type
- Only these 3 students had `classwork` type EXT1 assessments:
  1. **Ąžuolas Jonas Vainilka** (score: 0)
  2. **Bonifacijus Marijus Kiela** (score: 1)
  3. **Daumantas Jokūbas Van der Molen** (score: 1)

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Migration Script: `cleanupDuplicateEXT1.ts`

**What it did:**
1. ✅ **Migrated all `weekly_assessment` entries** (173 total) to `classwork` type
2. ✅ **Marked as experimental** by appending "(experimental)" to task names and titles
3. ✅ **Updated schema** to version 4.3
4. ✅ **Generated new file**: `progress_report_data_2025-11-03_v7.json`

**Example After Migration:**
```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-06",
  "column": "EXT1",
  "type": "classwork",                    // ← Now classwork!
  "task_name": "EXT1 assessment (experimental)",
  "assessment_id": "exercise-progress-weekly",
  "assessment_title": "Exercise Progress - Weekly Check (Experimental)"
}
```

## 📊 Current State (v7)

### October 6 EXT1 Assessments

**Total:** 57 entries (all now visible in Class View)

| Assessment ID | Type | Students | Score Range | Status |
|--------------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `exercise-progress-weekly` | classwork (experimental) | 54 | 0-1 | ✅ Migrated |
| `classwork-ext-ext1` | classwork | 3 | 0-1 | ✅ Original |

### What This Means

**All 57 students** now have October 6 EXT1 data showing in Class View because:
- All entries are now `classwork` type ✅
- Class View includes `classwork` in its assessment types ✅
- The column will be generated by `buildAssessmentColumns()` ✅

### Experimental Filtering

The migrated assessments are marked "(experimental)" and will be:
- ✅ **Shown in Class View** (experimental filtering not applied there)
- ❌ **Hidden in Student View Timeline** (experimental classwork filtered out)
- ❌ **Hidden in Learning Journey** (experimental classwork filtered out)

## 🎯 What the EXT Assessments Track

**Purpose:** Exercise Progress - Weekly Check

From column mapping config:
- **Type:** Classwork
- **Measures:** Number of exercises solved in classwork
- **Context:** These were experimental weekly check-ins from September-October 2025
