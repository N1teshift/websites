Concepts represent the vehicle for students' inquiry into the issues and ideas of personal, local and global significance, providing the means by which they can explore the essence of mathematics. Concepts have an important place in the structure of knowledge that requires students and teachers to think with increasing complexity as they organize and relate facts and topics. Concepts express understanding that students take with them into lifelong adventures of learning. They help students to develop principles, generalizations and theories. Students use conceptual understanding as they solve problems, analyse issues and evaluate decisions that can have an impact on themselves, their communities and the wider world.",
