    "formative_assessment_info": "List the ongoing methods you will use to check student understanding during lessons, such as questioning, exit tickets, drafts, or peer/self-assessment. Formative assessments provide feedback for both teacher and students, guiding adjustments before summative tasks. In MYP, they are crucial for scaffolding success."
