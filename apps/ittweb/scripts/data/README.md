# Data Generation Scripts

This README is intentionally short to keep old links alive. The canonical documentation for the pipeline now lives one level up at [`../README.md`](../README.md). It covers:

- An overview of every stage in the pipeline (extract → metadata → convert → icon map).
- Commands for running the full workflow or each script individually.
- Required inputs, expected outputs, and verification steps.
- References to the refactoring backlog and deep-dive docs inside `docs/systems/scripts/`.

If you landed here from older tooling or notes, jump to the top-level README and bookmark it—it’s the single source of truth for operating `scripts/data/`.
