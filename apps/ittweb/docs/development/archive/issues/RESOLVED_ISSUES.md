## Critical Issues

### Wipe Test Data - User Data Deletion Issue

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - False Alarm  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL (was suspected, but not confirmed)

**Issue Reported**:  
"Wipe all Data" button appeared to delete entire database including user data, but it should have preserved user data.

**Root Cause**:  
Poor internet connection caused UI to appear unresponsive, leading to assumption that userData was deleted.

**Actual Outcome**:  
System was working correctly - userData was preserved as expected.

**Expected Behavior**:

- Delete all Firestore collections EXCEPT `userData`
- Delete all files from Firebase Storage
- **Preserve** the entire `userData` collection with all user accounts

**Code Verification**:

- ✅ Filter at line 26 explicitly excludes `'userData'` collection
- ✅ Collection name constant matches: `'userData'` (camelCase)
- ✅ Only collections in `collectionsToDelete` array are processed
- ✅ Logging shows which collections are being deleted

**Resolution**:

- Verified code logic is correct
- Confirmed userData collection is properly excluded
- Issue was UI responsiveness due to network conditions, not actual data loss

**Lessons Learned**:

- Network latency can cause false alarms
- Logging helps verify correct behavior
- Code review confirmed proper implementation

## Analysis Patterns

### Bug Analysis Process

When analyzing bugs:

1. Verify expected vs actual behavior
2. Review code implementation
3. Check logging and error messages
4. Test edge cases
5. Document resolution

### False Alarm Indicators

Common causes of false alarms:

- Network latency causing UI delays
- Caching issues
- Race conditions in UI updates
- Misinterpretation of logs
