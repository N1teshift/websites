# Research Notes

**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Summary**: Research and analysis of reference implementations and feature comparisons

## Overview

This document summarizes research conducted on reference implementations, particularly the TWGB website, to identify features and patterns that could be implemented in the current project.

## TWGB Website Analysis

### Reference Implementation

**TWGB Website**: Ruby on Rails application tracking Island Troll Tribes game statistics, player ELO scores, and leaderboards.

**Current Project**: Modern Next.js application with guides, tools, and community features.

### Key Features Analyzed

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Implemented in current project

#### 2. Player Statistics & Profiles 👤

- Individual player pages with comprehensive stats
- Win/loss records by category
- ELO rating tracking over time
- Activity charts (games played per day)
- Class selection statistics
- Class-specific win rates
- Player comparison tool

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Implemented in current project

#### 3. ELO Rating System 📊

- ELO score calculation and tracking
- Category-based ELO (different game modes)

**Implementation Status**: ⚠️ Partially implemented - Guides exist, statistics pages missing

#### 6. Advanced Filtering 🔍

- Date range filtering (from/to dates)
- Category filtering (game modes)
- Team format filtering (1v1, 2v2, etc.)
- Ally/enemy filtering (games with specific players)

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Implemented in current project

## Pages Comparison

### Implemented Pages ✅

2. **`/players/[name]`** - Player profile page
   - ✅ Individual player profiles with stats
   - ✅ `/players` index/search page with compare mode toggle

3. **`/standings`** - Leaderboard page
   - ✅ Shows leaderboard with category filter

4. **`/players/compare`** - Player comparison
   - ✅ Head-to-head comparison + ELO chart

### Missing Pages ❌

1. **`/classes`** (Class Statistics)
   - Class overview page
   - Class detail page with statistics
   - Class win rates
   - Top players per class
   - **Status**: High priority, part of original plan

2. **`/meta`** (Meta Information)
   - Meta information page
   - **Status**: Low priority, informational page

3. **`/competitions`** (Competitions)
   - Competitions/tournaments page
   - **Status**: Future feature

4. **`/changelog`** (Changelog)
   - Game changelog page
   - **Status**: Could be added if needed

## API Routes Comparison

### Implemented API Routes ✅

- ✅ `GET /api/games` - List games
- ✅ `GET /api/games/[id]` - Get game
- ✅ `POST /api/games` - Create game
- ✅ `PUT /api/games/[id]` - Update game
- ✅ `DELETE /api/games/[id]` - Delete game
- ✅ `GET /api/players/[name]` - Get player stats
- ✅ `GET /api/players/search` - Search players
- ✅ `GET /api/players/compare` - Compare players
- ✅ `GET /api/standings` - Get leaderboard
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/activity` - Activity data
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/elo-history` - ELO history
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/win-rate` - Win rate data

### Missing API Routes ❌

- ❌ `GET /api/classes` - Class statistics
- ❌ `GET /api/classes/[className]` - Class detail

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features: ✅ 4/6 Implemented

- ✅ Games (list + detail)
- ✅ Players (profile + index/search)
- ✅ Standings
- ✅ Player comparison
- ⚠️ Class statistics (guides exist, stats missing)
- ❌ Competitions (future feature)

### API Routes: ✅ 11/13 Implemented

- ✅ All core game/player/standings APIs
- ❌ Class statistics APIs

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (P0)

1. **`/classes`** (Class Statistics)
   - Part of original plan (Phase 8)
   - Useful for meta analysis
   - Requires new API routes

### Medium Priority (P1)

2. **`/meta`** (TWGB-style write-up) + other informational pages
3. **`/competitions`** / **`/changelog`** (community storytelling)

### Low Priority (P2)

4. Optional alternative `/games_list` view / `/player_activity` standalone page

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reference implementations are valuable**: Analyzing existing systems helps identify features and patterns
2. **Not everything needs to be copied**: Some features may not fit the current project's goals
3. **Prioritization matters**: Focus on core features first, then enhancements
4. **Modern stack advantages**: Next.js provides better developer experience than older Rails apps
