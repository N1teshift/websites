# Documentation Archive

**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Purpose**: Historical documentation preserved for reference and context

Material in this folder is preserved for historical context only. Nothing here should be treated as the current source of truth, but it can be useful when you want to reference past research, decisions, or analyses.

## Archive Structure

The archive has been organized into category folders for easier navigation:

### Category Folders

- **`history/`** - Historical documentation and milestones
  - `CLEANUP_HISTORY.md` - Historical cleanup efforts, plans, and categorizations
  - `DOCUMENTATION_HISTORY.md` - Documentation audits, plans, status reports, and meta-documentation
  - `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` - Early development milestones and foundation setup (Phase 0)

- **`analysis/`** - Code and system analyses
  - `LOGGING_ANALYSIS.md` - Logging inconsistency analysis and infrastructure logging system
  - `OPTIMIZATION_HISTORY.md` - Performance optimizations, query reviews, and code pattern audits
  - `DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW.md` - Documentation review plan for accuracy and consistency

- **`issues/`** - Resolved bugs and issues
  - `RESOLVED_ISSUES.md` - Resolved bugs and issues with analysis and solutions

- **`research/`** - Research and reference implementations
  - `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` - Research on reference implementations (TWGB website analysis, feature comparisons)

- **`data/`** - Data exploration and extraction
  - `DATA_EXPLORATION.md` - Data extraction and processing implementation summaries

- **`indexes/`** - Firestore index documentation
  - `FIRESTORE_INDEXES_HISTORY.md` - Historical Firestore index documentation (now consolidated)

### Root Files

- **`ARCHIVE_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md`** - Proposal document outlining cleanup approaches

## What's Archived

These summaries consolidate information from:

- Analysis documents (cleanup plans, comparisons, categorizations)
- Meta-documentation (documentation about documentation)
- Bug analyses and resolved issues
- Performance reviews and optimizations
- Research notes and reference implementations
- Data exploration and extraction work
- Historical Firestore index documentation
- Logging analysis and recommendations
- Documentation review plans
- Development milestones

## Using the Archive

When you need to:

- **Understand past decisions**: Check `history/` folder
- **Reference historical patterns**: Look in `analysis/OPTIMIZATION_HISTORY.md` or `history/DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`
- **Review resolved issues**: See `issues/RESOLVED_ISSUES.md`
- **Understand cleanup efforts**: See `history/CLEANUP_HISTORY.md`
- **Research reference implementations**: See `research/RESEARCH_NOTES.md`
