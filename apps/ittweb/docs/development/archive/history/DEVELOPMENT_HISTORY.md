# Development History

**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Summary**: Historical development milestones and foundation setup

## Overview

This document summarizes early development milestones, particularly Phase 0 foundation work.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Setup

**Completed**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✅ All tasks completed

### Summary

Phase 0 successfully established the foundation for the game statistics system with all directory structures, types, base services, and configuration files created.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Feature Directory Structure ✅

Created complete directory structure for all features:

- `src/features/modules/games/` - Game tracking
- `src/features/modules/players/` - Player statistics
- `src/features/modules/standings/` - Leaderboards
- `src/features/modules/analytics/` - Analytics and charts
- `src/features/modules/shared/` - Shared utilities

Each feature has:

- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/` - Service layer (business logic)
- `components/` - React components (placeholder)
- `hooks/` - React hooks (placeholder)

#### 2. TypeScript Types ✅

Created comprehensive type definitions:

- **Games**: `Game`, `GamePlayer`, `CreateGame`, `UpdateGame`, `GameFilters`
- **Players**: `PlayerStats`, `PlayerProfile`, `CategoryStats`, `PlayerComparison`
- **Standings**: `StandingsEntry`, `StandingsResponse`, `StandingsFilters`
- **Analytics**: `ActivityDataPoint`, `EloHistoryDataPoint`, `WinRateData`, `ClassStats`
- **Shared**: `DateRange`, `DateRangePreset`, `FilterState`

#### 3. Dependencies Installed ✅

Successfully installed:

- `recharts` - Chart library
- `date-fns` - Date utilities
- `react-datepicker` - Date picker component
- `zod` - Schema validation

#### 4. Firestore Rules Updated ✅

Added security rules for:

- `games` collection (public read, authenticated write)
- `games/{gameId}/players` subcollection
- `playerStats` collection (public read, server-only write)
- `eloHistory` collection (public read, server-only write)
- `classStats` collection (public read, server-only write)

#### 5. Base Service Files Created ✅

Created service files with placeholder implementations:

- `games/lib/gameService.ts` - Game CRUD operations
- `games/lib/eloCalculator.ts` - ELO calculation logic
- `players/lib/playerService.ts` - Player operations
- `standings/lib/standingsService.ts` - Leaderboard operations
- `analytics/lib/analyticsService.ts` - Analytics calculations

All services include:

- Function signatures with proper types
- Logging setup
- TODO comments for implementation
- Error throwing for unimplemented functions

#### 6. Barrel Exports Created ✅

Created `index.ts` files for clean imports:

- Feature-level exports (`games/index.ts`, etc.)
- Component exports (placeholders)
- Hook exports (placeholders)
- Service exports

#### 7. Shared Utilities ✅

Created `shared/utils/index.ts` with helper functions:

- `formatDuration()` - Format seconds to human-readable string
- `formatEloChange()` - Format ELO change with sign

## Next Steps (Historical)

Phase 0 was complete, ready to proceed to **Phase 1: Core Data Layer**.

### Phase 1 Tasks (Historical):

1. Implement `gameService.ts` - Game CRUD operations
2. Implement `eloCalculator.ts` - ELO calculation logic
3. Implement `playerService.ts` - Player operations
4. Create API routes for games
5. Add Firestore indexes (manual setup required)

## Notes

- All service functions initially threw "Not yet implemented" errors
- Firestore collections needed to be created manually or via script
- Firestore indexes needed to be set up in Firebase Console
- Type definitions were complete and ready for implementation
- Dependencies were installed and ready to use

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] TypeScript types defined
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] Firestore rules updated
- [x] Base service files created
- [x] Barrel exports created
- [x] Shared utilities created
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No linting errors

## Current State

Phase 0 foundation work has been completed and the system has evolved significantly since then. The structure and patterns established in Phase 0 continue to guide the project's architecture.
