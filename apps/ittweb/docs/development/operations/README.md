# Operations & Testing

Use this folder when you need to run, seed, or verify the app locally.

- `quick-start-testing.md` – shortest path to spin up the dev server and create sample games via the Scheduled Games form (includes `/players` verification steps).
- `testing-guide.md` – detailed scenarios (API calls, manual validations, troubleshooting).

Every document here assumes the data pipeline in `scripts/data/` has been run recently (`node scripts/data/main.mjs`). Both guides link back to `../../scripts/README.md` so you're never more than one click away from the regeneration instructions.
