# Replay Parser & Scheduled Games Integration Plan

**Status:** Planning Phase _(references former `src/features/ittweb` paths; current code lives in `src/features/modules`)_  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX  
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

This plan outlines the integration of:

1. **Scheduled Games** with **Game Statistics** system
2. **Warcraft 3 Replay Parser** for automatic game data extraction
3. **Replay Upload** functionality (reusing Archives infrastructure – see `src/features/shared/lib/archiveService.ts::uploadReplay`)

---

## 1. Merging Scheduled Games with Game Stats

### 1.1 Database Schema Updates

#### Unified Games Collection (Current Implementation)

The system uses a unified `games` collection with `gameState` field:

```typescript
interface Game {
  // ... existing fields ...
  gameState: 'scheduled' | 'completed';  // Unified collection approach
  scheduledGameId?: number;     // Numeric scheduled game ID
  scheduledDateTime?: Timestamp; // When game was scheduled
  participants?: Array<{...}>;  // Scheduled game participants
  datetime?: Timestamp;         // When game was actually played (completed games)
  players?: Array<{...}>;       // Game players (completed games)
  replayUrl?: string;          // Replay file URL (if uploaded)
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

**Note:** The current implementation uses a unified `games` collection rather than separate `scheduledGames` and `games` collections. When a replay is uploaded, the same document is updated from `gameState: 'scheduled'` to `gameState: 'completed'`.

### 1.2 Integration Points

#### A. Scheduled Game Detail Page

- Add "Record Result" button when game status is `scheduled` or `completed`
- Button opens replay upload form OR manual entry form
- After game is recorded, update scheduled game:
  - Set `status` to `completed`
  - Link `gameId` and `gameResultId`
  - Set `completedAt` timestamp

#### B. Game Creation Flow

When creating a game (via replay or manual):

1. Check if `scheduledGameId` is provided
2. If yes, update the scheduled game record
3. Link the game back to scheduled game

#### C. Scheduled Games List

- Show status badges: `Scheduled`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`
- For completed games, show link to game result
- Show "Record Result" button for past scheduled games without results

### 1.3 API Updates

#### New Endpoint: `POST /api/scheduled-games/[id]/record-result`

```typescript
// Body: Either replay file OR manual game data
{
  type: 'replay' | 'manual';
  replayFile?: File;           // If type === 'replay'
  gameData?: CreateGame;       // If type === 'manual'
}
```

#### Update: `PUT /api/scheduled-games/[id]`

- Allow updating status to `completed` or `cancelled`
- Allow linking `gameId` when result is recorded

---

## 2. Warcraft 3 Replay Parser

### 2.1 Technology Choice

**Recommended:** Use existing Node.js libraries:

- `@w3g/replay` or `w3gjs` - JavaScript replay parsers
- Alternative: `w3g` (Python) with Node.js subprocess (if needed)

**Research needed:**

- Check which parser supports W3MMD data (Island Troll Tribes uses W3MMD)
- Verify compatibility with current Warcraft 3 versions

### 2.2 Parser Service Structure

```
src/features/modules/games/
├── lib/
│   ├── replayParser.ts        # Main parser service (already exists)
│   ├── w3mmdUtils.ts         # W3MMD-specific utilities (already exists)
│   └── replayValidator.ts     # Validate replay file
```

### 2.3 Data Extraction

#### Basic Game Data

```typescript
interface ParsedGameData {
  gameId: number; // From replay header
  datetime: Date; // Game start time
  duration: number; // Game duration in seconds
  gamename: string; // Game name
  map: string; // Map name
  creatorName: string; // Creator name (standardized field)
  createdByDiscordId?: string; // Creator Discord ID (standardized field)
}
```

#### Player Data (from W3MMD)

```typescript
interface ParsedPlayerData {
  name: string; // Player name
  pid: number; // Player ID (0-11)
  flag: "winner" | "loser" | "drawer";
  category?: string; // Game category (from W3MMD vars)
  class?: string; // Troll class (from W3MMD vars)
  randomClass?: boolean; // Whether class was random
  kills?: number;
  deaths?: number;
  assists?: number;
  gold?: number;
  damageDealt?: number;
  damageTaken?: number;
}
```

#### W3MMD Variables to Extract

- `class` - Troll class name
- `random` - Random class flag
- `kills` - Kill count
- `deaths` - Death count
- `gold` - Gold amount
- `category` - Game category (1v1, 2v2, etc.)
- Any other custom stats

### 2.4 Parser Implementation

```typescript
// src/features/modules/games/lib/replayParser.ts (already exists)

export interface ParseReplayResult {
  game: ParsedGameData;
  players: ParsedPlayerData[];
  isValid: boolean;
  errors?: string[];
}

export async function parseReplayFile(
  file: File | Buffer | string // File path or buffer
): Promise<ParseReplayResult> {
  // 1. Read replay file
  // 2. Parse with w3g library
  // 3. Extract basic game info
  // 4. Extract W3MMD data
  // 5. Map players to winners/losers/drawers
  // 6. Extract player stats
  // 7. Validate data
  // 8. Return structured data
}
```

### 2.5 Validation

- Verify replay is from Island Troll Tribes map
- Check that W3MMD data exists
- Validate player count (at least 2)
- Verify winners/losers are properly flagged
- Check for duplicate gameId

---

## 3. Replay Upload Integration

### 3.1 Reuse Archives Upload Infrastructure

The Archives feature already has:

- ✅ File upload to Firebase Storage (`uploadReplay` in `archiveService.ts`)
- ✅ File input handling (`MediaSelector` component)
- ✅ File validation

### 3.2 New Upload Endpoints

#### Option A: Separate Game Replay Upload

```
POST /api/games/upload-replay
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: { replayFile: File }
Response: { gameId: string, parsedData: ParseReplayResult }
```

#### Option B: Integrated with Game Creation

```
POST /api/games
Body: {
  type: 'replay' | 'manual',
  replayFile?: File,
  gameData?: CreateGame
}
```

**Recommendation:** Option B - Single endpoint handles both cases

### 3.3 Upload Flow

1. **User uploads replay file**
   - Via scheduled game "Record Result" button
   - Via games page "Upload Replay" button
   - Via manual game creation form

2. **Server processes replay**
   - Upload file to Firebase Storage
   - Parse replay file
   - Extract game and player data
   - Validate data

3. **Create game record**
   - Use parsed data to create game
   - Calculate ELO changes
   - Update player stats
   - Link to scheduled game (if applicable)

4. **Return result**
   - Success: Return game ID and link
   - Error: Return validation errors

### 3.4 UI Components

#### A. Replay Upload Form Component

```typescript
// src/features/modules/games/components/ReplayUploadForm.tsx
interface ReplayUploadFormProps {
  scheduledGameId?: string; // Optional: Link to scheduled game
  onSuccess: (gameId: string) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
}
```

#### B. Update Scheduled Game Component

Add "Record Result" section:

- Upload replay button
- Manual entry button
- Show linked game result if exists

#### C. Game Creation Form Enhancement

- Add "Upload Replay" option alongside manual entry
- Show parsed data preview before submission
- Allow editing parsed data if needed

## 5. Technical Considerations

### 5.1 File Size Limits

- Warcraft 3 replays are typically 100KB - 2MB
- Set Firebase Storage upload limit appropriately
- Consider chunked uploads for very large files

### 5.2 Parser Performance

- Replay parsing can be CPU-intensive
- Consider:
  - Background job processing (Firebase Functions)
  - Queue system for multiple uploads
  - Progress updates for long-running parses

### 5.3 Data Validation

- Not all replays will have W3MMD data
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Allow manual correction of parsed data
- Flag games that need manual review

### 5.4 Security

- Validate file type (must be .w3g)
- Scan for malicious files
- Rate limit uploads per user
- Authenticate uploads (require login)

### 5.5 Error Scenarios

- Invalid replay file format
- Missing W3MMD data
- Corrupted replay file
- Unsupported Warcraft 3 version
- Duplicate gameId
- Parsing errors

---

## 6. Dependencies

### New NPM Packages Needed

```json
{
  "w3gjs": "^1.0.0", // Or similar replay parser
  // OR
  "w3g": "^1.0.0" // Alternative parser
}
```

**Note:** Need to research which parser works best for W3MMD data

### Firebase Storage

- Already configured (used by Archives)
- Need to create `replays/` folder structure
- Set appropriate security rules

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Parser functions
- Data extraction logic
- Validation logic
- W3MMD parsing

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end upload flow
- Game creation from replay
- Scheduled game linking
- Error scenarios

### Manual Testing

- Upload various replay files
- Test with missing W3MMD data
- Test with different game types
- Test scheduled game integration

---

## 8. Migration Path

### For Existing Scheduled Games

1. Add migration script to add new fields
2. Set default values for existing games
3. Allow manual linking of past games

### For Future Games

1. New scheduled games automatically support result recording
2. Games created from replays can link back to scheduled games
3. Both systems work seamlessly together

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can upload .w3g replay files
- ✅ Games are automatically created from replays
- ✅ Scheduled games can be linked to results
- ✅ Parsed data is accurate
- ✅ Error handling is robust
- ✅ UI is intuitive and clear
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (< 5s for parsing)

---

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Research replay parser libraries**
   - Test with Island Troll Tribes replays
   - Verify W3MMD data extraction
   - Choose best library

2. **Create proof of concept**
   - Parse a single replay file
   - Extract basic data
   - Validate approach

3. **Start Phase 1 implementation**
   - Build parser service
   - Test with various replays
   - Iterate on data extraction

4. **Plan UI/UX**
   - Design upload flow
   - Design scheduled game integration
   - Get user feedback

---

## Notes

- **W3MMD Support:** Island Troll Tribes uses W3MMD (Warcraft 3 Multi-Map Data) system. Ensure parser supports this.
- **Replay Versions:** Different Warcraft 3 versions may have different replay formats. Test compatibility.
- **Manual Fallback:** Always allow manual entry if replay parsing fails.
- **Data Correction:** Allow admins to correct parsed data if errors occur.
