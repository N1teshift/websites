# Systems Documentation

Deep dives for the main subsystems that power ITTWeb. Start here when you need architectural context or when onboarding a co-developer.

- `game-stats/implementation-plan.md` – design + milestones for the statistics experience (services, APIs, UI breakdown).
- `data-pipeline/` – complete documentation for the data generation pipeline (architecture, schemas, troubleshooting, guides).
- `replay-parser/` – integration plan and quick start for processing replays.
- `timestamp-time-management.md` – comprehensive guide to timestamp handling, standardization patterns, and best practices for Firestore timestamps.

Each subfolder owns its own structure; keep write-ups current and move anything outdated into the relevant `archive/` subfolder to avoid confusion.
