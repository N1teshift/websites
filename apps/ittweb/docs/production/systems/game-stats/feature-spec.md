## UI Component Checklist

- `GameList`, `GameCard`, `GameDetail` – shared loading/error/empty states.
- `PlayerProfile`, `PlayerStats`, `PlayerCharts`, `PlayerGames` – compose the profile view.
- `Leaderboard` – sortable table with rank, wins/losses, win rate, current ELO.
- `PlayerComparison` – side-by-side metrics plus shared chart legend.
- `ClassOverview` / `ClassDetail` – reuse card layout from guides for consistency.

## Filters & State

- `DateRangeFilter`, `CategoryFilter`, `PlayerFilter`, `TeamFormatFilter`, `GameFilters` container, and `useGameFilters` hook.
- Filters persist via URL query params + `localStorage` so deep links reproduce state.
- Build Firestore queries through `buildGameQuery(filters)` to centralize validation and index usage.

## Analytics Surfaces

- `ActivityChart` (area) – games per day with zoom + brush.
- `EloChart` (line) – multi-player overlay.
- `WinRateChart` (pie) – win/loss/draw distribution.
- `ClassStatsChart` (bar/pie) – frequency + win-rate combos.
- All charts live in `shared/charts/` and are wrapped with `React.memo`.

## Admin & DX Notes

- Creation/update/delete endpoints are admin-only and must log via `loggerUtils.ts`.
- Hooks expose loading + optimistic states so admin flows stay responsive.
- Reference `delivery-plan.md` for the rollout order; each phase adds the components listed here.
