## Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Days | Focus                                        | Exit Criteria                                              |
| ----- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 1-2  | Directory structure, types, indexes, deps    | Modules scaffolded, rules + indexes deployed               |
| 1     | 3-5  | Core services (games, ELO, players) + APIs   | CRUD endpoints green, unit tests for ELO + normalization   |
| 2     | 3-4  | Games UI (list/detail, creation form, hooks) | `/games` + `/games/[id]` live with loading/error states    |
| 3     | 4-5  | Player profiles + search                     | `/players` + `/players/[name]` fully functional            |
| 4     | 2-3  | Leaderboards                                 | `/standings` shipped with pagination + thresholds          |
| 5     | 3-4  | Advanced filters + query builder             | Filter panel synced to URL, queries covered by tests       |
| 6     | 4-5  | Analytics & charts                           | Activity/ELO/win-rate/class charts integrated and memoized |
| 7     | 2-3  | Player comparison                            | Comparison page + head-to-head APIs                        |
| 8     | 3-4  | Class statistics                             | `/classes` surfaces + integration links                    |
| 9     | 2-3  | Polish, perf, docs, E2E                      | Performance targets met, docs + release checklist complete |

**Optimistic:** ~27 days. **Realistic:** 7-8 weeks with review + hardening buffers.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** ELO math, name normalization, query builders, filter utilities.
- **Integration:** Game creation/update/delete, player stat refresh, filter permutations.
- **E2E:** Game submission → list/detail, player search/profile, leaderboard drill-down, comparison flows.
- **Performance:** 1k+ games, complex filters, chart rendering in low-end devices.
- **Tooling:** Reuse existing Playwright/Cypress harness and logger assertions.

## Data Migration Path

1. **Manual entry (Phase 1):** Seed curated games to validate UX + ELO.
2. **Import script:** Map `twgb-website` exports to Firestore, replaying through `eloCalculator.updateEloScores`.
3. **Replay parser (future):** Automate ingestion once parser MVP is ready; treat as a separate project.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                   | Impact | Mitigation                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ELO calculation errors | High   | Unit tests, sample verification vs twgb data, rollback + recalc tooling |
| Firestore costs/perf   | High   | Proper indexes, pagination, caching/lazy loading, billing alerts        |
| Data integrity         | High   | Strict validation, transactional updates, audit logging                 |
| Player name variance   | Medium | Normalization + aliases, admin merge tooling                            |

## Success Metrics

- Functional: games recorded & visible, ELO accurate, filters + charts behave as spec.
- Performance: `/games` < 2s, `/players/[name]` < 3s, leaderboards < 2s, charts < 1s render time.
- User value: players find their data, comparisons make sense, admins can correct mistakes fast.

## Timeline & Release Strategy

1. Ship **MVP (Phases 0-4)** to internal testers → validate core UX and ELO trust.
2. Enable **Enhanced (5-7)** capabilities once analytics + filters pass design review.
3. Finish **Complete (8-9)** work, run regression + load tests, then announce via Blog/Product docs.
4. Post-launch, monitor metrics (Firestore spend, latency, error rates) and plan replay automation separately.
