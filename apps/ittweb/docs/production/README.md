## 🎯 Purpose

This documentation represents the **core value** of your ITT Web project:

- Custom API endpoints and business logic
- Domain-specific data models and schemas
- User-facing features and functionality
- Security implementations
- System integrations

When your project goes live, this is the documentation you'll want to keep and potentially share with users, maintainers, or other developers working on similar systems.
