## 🧱 Data Pipeline Source

- All static item/unit/ability data originates from the four-stage pipeline in `scripts/data/`.
- Run `node scripts/data/main.mjs` (see [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md)) whenever you need to refresh the dataset before validating features described here.
- Refactoring status for those scripts lives in [`scripts/data/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`](../../scripts/data/REFACTORING_PLAN.md) if you need to understand in-flight maintenance work.

  "gameId": 12345,
  "datetime": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "duration": 1800,
  "gamename": "Test Game",
  "map": "Island Troll Tribes",
  "creatorName": "Creator",
  "category": "1v1",

    { "name": "Player1", "pid": 0, "flag": "winner" },
    { "name": "Player2", "pid": 1, "flag": "loser" }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: This endpoint requires authentication. The `creatorName` and `createdByDiscordId` fields are automatically filled from the session if not provided.
