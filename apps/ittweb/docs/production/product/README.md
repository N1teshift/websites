# Product Documentation

This folder collects everything you need to understand **what** was built and **why it matters**.

- `summary.md` – polished overview of the shipped feature set (share with stakeholders, recruiters, or future collaborators) plus links to the `/meta` live dashboard.
- `status.md` – phased roadmap with what’s completed vs. still in flight (tracks the `/players` index/comparison rollout, analytics work, etc.).
- `improvements.md` – infrastructure/DX upgrades ported from other projects.
- `user-roles.md` – who has access to what (helpful for onboarding or demos).

_Tip: keep these files presentation-ready. When you ship something significant, update `summary.md` + `status.md` first so the rest of the docs stay in sync._
