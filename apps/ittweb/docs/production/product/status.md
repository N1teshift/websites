# Game Statistics System - Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Overall Progress:** ~90% Complete  
**Build Status:** ✅ **STABLE** - Project builds successfully on Vercel

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Dependency

- The player/unit/item data that feeds this system comes from `scripts/data/`.
- Before validating new UI phases, refresh the dataset via `node scripts/data/main.mjs` (see [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md)).
- Script maintenance/backlog is tracked in [`scripts/data/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`](../../scripts/data/REFACTORING_PLAN.md).
