/**
 * Scheduled Game Service - Main Entry Point
 *
 * This file re-exports all scheduled game service functions from split modules for backward compatibility.
 * The service has been split into smaller modules:
 * - scheduledGameService.utils.ts - Helper functions (deriveGameStatus, getNextScheduledGameId)
 * - scheduledGameService.create.ts - Create operations
 * - scheduledGameService.read.ts - Read operations (getAllScheduledGames, getScheduledGameById)
 * - scheduledGameService.read.helpers.ts - Read helper functions (data conversion, filtering)
 * - scheduledGameService.update.ts - Update operations
 * - scheduledGameService.delete.ts - Delete operations
 * - scheduledGameService.participation.ts - Join/leave operations
 */
