## Exports

### Components

- `ScheduledGameForm` - Create/edit scheduled game form
- `ScheduledGameDetail` - Detailed scheduled game view
- `JoinGameButton` - Join/leave game button
- `ScheduledGameFilters` - Filter scheduled games

### Services

- `scheduledGameService` - Scheduled game CRUD operations (split into focused modules: create, read, update, delete, participation, utils)
  - `getAllScheduledGames()` - Get all scheduled games
  - `getScheduledGameById()` - Get single scheduled game
  - `createScheduledGame()` - Create new scheduled game
  - `updateScheduledGame()` - Update scheduled game
  - `deleteScheduledGame()` - Delete scheduled game
  - `joinScheduledGame()` - Join a scheduled game
  - `leaveScheduledGame()` - Leave a scheduled game

**Note**: `scheduledGameService` has been split into multiple focused modules for maintainability:

- `scheduledGameService.ts` - Main entry point (re-exports all functions)
- `scheduledGameService.create.ts` - Create operations
- `scheduledGameService.read.ts` - Read operations
- `scheduledGameService.read.helpers.ts` - Read helper functions (data conversion, filtering)
- `scheduledGameService.update.ts` - Update operations
- `scheduledGameService.delete.ts` - Delete operations
- `scheduledGameService.participation.ts` - Join/leave game operations
- `scheduledGameService.utils.ts` - Helper functions

All functions are still available via the main `scheduledGameService` import for backward compatibility.

### Utils

- `timezoneUtils` - Timezone conversion utilities

```typescript
import {
  getAllScheduledGames,
  createScheduledGame,
} from "@/features/modules/game-management/scheduled-games/lib/scheduledGameService";
